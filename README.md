The web doesn't have an API, so I decided to use puppeteer to extract the data with an automatic login.

- I'm trying to fetch the data with the cookies of previous session.
- The data is converted to json and I need to combine two arrays of objects because the day of the week and the hours worked are in diferent documents.
